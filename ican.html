    <h2> High school</h2>
    <p>I am a young woman from the Democratic Republic of Congo,
      From a very early age I valued education: I started school in <strong>September 2011</strong> at
      Mot Sinai in Ndosho TPD. Growing up through changes in neighbourhoods and schools taught me
      resilience and determination.</p>
    <p>I completed primary school at <strong>Complexe Scolaire Ushindi, Ndosho</strong>. I then joined
      <strong>Institut Maranatha</strong> for my secondary education, where I graduated in sciences
      (This is math, physics, biology and chemistry)
      and ranked always among the top five students in my class. After finishing high
      school I earned a scholarship to <strong>Cornerstone Leadership Academy</strong>, an experience
      that opened many new opportunities and helped me discover my leadership potential.
    </p>
    <p>My interest in the mining sector began during a geology lesson, when I learned more about the
      Democratic Republic of Congo's natural resources. Since then I decided to pursue studies and a
      career that would allow me to build technology solutions for mining. </p>

    <h2> University</h2>
    <p> Currently studying at Bugema University, Kampala Campus, I'm working toward becoming an
      embedded systems engineer. I'm grateful for the mentorship of friends like Mahamudi Simuke Julie
      and Nyota Sanda Divine, who recognize and encourage my potential.
