    <h1>Who i am </h1>

    <p> I am a young girl from the Democratic,
      Republic of Congo, born on <strong>October 29, 2008
      </strong> in Goma (Carmel Hospital) and who always seeks success in life and believes
      in the power of education.
      I started my educational journey when I was only three years old. Many people doubted
      whether I could succeed because I had not attended infant school, but I was determined to
      prove them wrong.</p>
    <p> ction>
    <p >I am Safi Ngendahayo Active. My origin is DRC, Goma, North Kivu. I am pursuing my
      studies and currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Uganda, Kampala. I have six
      siblings and I am the first born.</p>

    <p> am skilled in HTML, CSS, and Arduino. I can work on small projects. I have decided to do
      software engineering because I want to become an embedded system engineer who will
      contribute to the enhancement of the future mining sector.</p>

    <p>I have been participating in debates, making capstone presentations, volunteering, and
      serving as a captain of the volleyball team. All these experiences have helped me
      develop various skills, including time management.</p>

    <p>I enjoy playing games like volleyball, Mangala, and dodgeball, listening to music,
      visiting new places, watching movies or reading books about technology in my free time.
      My best moments are gatherings where people from different places meet
      and start discussions.</p>

    <p>As for achievements, I have participated in IEEE events, GDG events, and Ethnic conferences
      to boost my skills and interact with new developers.
      I have completed for International Computer Driving License(ICDL).</p>

<p>In short, this is my story — a story of determination, curiosity, and faith. I believe in
  using education, technology, and leadership to build a better future for myself and for
  the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
