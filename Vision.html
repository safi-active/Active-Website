        <h1> My Vision & Dream</h1>

        <q>My vision for life may sound smooth when spoken about, but achieving it is not
            easy especially if laziness comes into play.</q>
        <p>I come from a family where many members
            work in the mining sector. I have witnessed firsthand how a small mineral can change
            someone’s life, lifting them to new heights. Yet, I have also seen the devastating
            consequences when things collapse: lives are lost, and our country loses valuable
            resources.</p>

        <p>One day, while studying geology, our teacher emphasized the importance of the natural
            resources in the DRC. From that day, I began to reflect deeply on what I wanted to pursue
            at university. That’s how my passion for <strong>mineralogy</strong> and the <strong>mining
                sector</strong> started. I wanted to find ways to improve how resources are used and
            to make sure they benefit our communities.</p>

        <p>Since my high school years, I have got to know that many of the
            technological assets that we use today evolve thanks to the mineral resources of the Democratic
            Republic of Congo (DRC); This truth makes me feel both guilty and deeply motivated.
            Guilty, because our country holds the keys to global innovation but has not yet
            unlocked its full potential. Motivated, because I carry within me a strong spirit
            a burning desire to contribute to changing this narrative. known not only for its
            minerals, but also for the intelligent systems, innovations, and technologies created
            by its own people.</p>

        <p>My passion lies
            in innovation and technology. My vision is to see the DRC become a strong
            exporting country where opportunities are limitless. We cannot rely on others
            to develop our nation for us. I want to see poverty reduced, and our youth
            empowered. Too often, those who study hard still watch outsiders enjoy our
            wealth, while local youth struggle, sometimes being forced to work with the
            army.</p>

        <p>I firmly believe that the potential of our minds is enough to
            drive innovation. We have everything needed to contribute to the evolution of
            our country. I call upon everyone, especially the youth, who want to build
            a future where coming generations do not suffer as we do, to join me in
            making this vision a reality for the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
